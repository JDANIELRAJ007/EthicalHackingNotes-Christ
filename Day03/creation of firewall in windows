Creating a **firewall** in Windows means setting up rules and configurations that control incoming and outgoing network traffic to protect your system from unauthorized access. Windows has a built-in firewall called **Windows Defender Firewall**.

Here’s a **step-by-step guide** to create or configure firewall rules in Windows:

---

### 🔒 1. **Open Windows Defender Firewall**

1. Press `Win + S` (search), type **"Windows Defender Firewall"**, and press **Enter**.
2. Click **"Advanced settings"** on the left side.
   (This opens the **Windows Defender Firewall with Advanced Security** window.)

---

### 🛠️ 2. **Create a New Inbound/Outbound Rule**

You can control:

* **Inbound Rules** – traffic coming **into** your PC.
* **Outbound Rules** – traffic going **out of** your PC.

#### ✅ To create a new rule:

1. Click **Inbound Rules** or **Outbound Rules** on the left.
2. On the right panel, click **"New Rule…"**

### 🔧 3. **Choose the Type of Rule**

* **Program** – Block/Allow a specific application.
* **Port** – Control traffic through a specific port (e.g., 80 for HTTP).
* **Predefined** – Use built-in rule templates.
* **Custom** – Fully configure your own rule.

Click **Next** after selecting.

### 🔍 4. **Specify the Details**

* For **Program**: Browse and select the `.exe` file of the application.
* For **Port**: Specify TCP or UDP and the port number.
* For **Custom**: You can define IP addresses, protocols, ports, and programs.

Click **Next**.

### 🔒 5. **Choose What to Do**

* **Allow the connection**
* **Allow if it is secure**
* **Block the connection** (for firewall protection)

Click **Next**.

### 🌐 6. **Choose the Profile**

Select when this rule applies:

* **Domain** – When connected to a domain controller.
* **Private** – Home or work network.
* **Public** – Public places (e.g., café Wi-Fi).

Click **Next**.

---

### 📝 7. **Name the Rule**

* Give it a meaningful name (e.g., `Block Chrome Internet Access`)
* Optionally, add a description.

Click **Finish**.

### ✅ Done!

Your firewall rule is now active. You can view, edit, or delete it from the Advanced Settings window.
