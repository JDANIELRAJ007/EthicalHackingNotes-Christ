Day-04: Key Networking & Scanning Concepts – Ethical Hacking
📡 Network
A group of connected devices sharing data/resources.
Types:

LAN (wired)

Wi-Fi (wireless)

Protocol:

TCP/IP

🧠 Summit
Cybersecurity conference.
Includes:

Talks

Live demos

CTFs (Capture The Flag)

Networking opportunities

🔐 MAC ID
Unique address for each network device

Example: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E

Works at OSI Layer 2

🌐 IP Address
Identifies devices on a network

Types:

IPv4 → Example: 192.168.1.1

IPv6

Can be Static or Dynamic

🔄 TCP vs UDP Protocol
Feature	TCP	UDP
Connection	Yes	No
Reliable	Yes	No

📢 Broadcast
Sends packets to all devices in a network

Common in:

ARP

Network discovery

🔁 NAT (Network Address Translation)
Converts private IPs ↔ public IPs

Types:

Static

Dynamic

PAT (Port Address Translation)

Purpose: Allows many devices to share one public IP

🔂 Port Forwarding
Redirects traffic to a specific internal device

Used for:

Remote access

Web servers, game hosting, etc.

🧩 Subnetting
Breaks large networks into smaller subnets

Benefits:
✅ Reduces network traffic
✅ Improves routing
✅ Adds security
✅ Enables VLANs

🧮 Subnetting Example:
CIDR Notation: 192.168.1.0/24

Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0

Usable IPs: 192.168.1.1 – 192.168.1.254

Broadcast IP: 192.168.1.255

🧪 Nmap Command (Advanced Scan)
bash
CopyEdit
nmap -T4 -A -sV -O -oN output.txt --script default -vv -p 1-1000 -sS -sT target.com
🔑 Key Flags:
-T4: Faster scan

-A: OS and version detection

-sV: Service version detection

-O: OS detection

-sS: Stealth SYN scan

-sT: TCP connect scan

--script default: Runs default scripts

-vv: Very verbose output

-p 1-1000: Scans ports 1 through 1000
